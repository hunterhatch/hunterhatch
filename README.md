Hello my name is Hunter Hatch. I'm a freshman computer science major at Penn State.
I'm currently learning C++ and I wish to open my own freelance software company after I graduate.
I wish to create free and open source applications that genuinely benefit the world.
Any advice I could get starting this adventure into the coding scene is greatly appreciated.

Have a great day everyone!
